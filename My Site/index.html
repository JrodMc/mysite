      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am an aspiring web designer who loves to create beautiful 
        projects that get peoples attention.  I am an advid Star Wars fan who cannot 
      wait to explore the far away galaxies.  Sometimes to get there, we have to climb
      the path up and down through mountains.

        <h3>Web Design & Coding</h3>
        <p>I became fasinated with computers at a young age.  We were too poor growing up
          to own a computer.  Everytime we would go to a store that had computers, I would
          try to break the passcode so I could play minesweep (along the way probably destroying
          files I should not have).  In 2001 I was overseas as a missionary when I was asked to 
          create a website for the ministry.  I had never done such a thing but immediately fell
          in love with the idea of creating websites.  Fast forward 20+ years, I am finally exploring
          this dream.

        <h3>In a Galaxy Far Far Away...</h3>
        <p>Ever since watching Star Wars as a young boy, my mind has been stuck in a galaxy far 
          far away.  I still play...um...collect Star Wars memorabilia.  Talking Star Wars may 
          not be a documented skillset, but it should be!  Right?
